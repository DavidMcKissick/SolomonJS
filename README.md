# SolomonJS
### A DOM manipulation library focused on quick but powerful page generation.
#### Solomon is back, baby.
#### I've decided to continue work on solomon. It will be getting a total remastering for Solomon 2.0 featuring more advanced and streamlined features.

## Setup
1. Download your desired version of SolomonJS.
2. Put the .js file in your project folder or on the server you wish to use as a cdn.
3. Add `<script src="[wherever you put it]">` at the top of your html `<body>`
4. Add id="root" to the root of your html `<body>`
5. Done.
Once initial setup is completed. Visit [the wiki](https://github.com/DavidMcKissick/SolomonJS/wiki)
to get acquainted with Solomons capabilities. Happy coding!  
  
## Who what and why?
Solomon is mostly made for personal projects, however as the project has grown, a few friends and colleagues have shown
interest. So I've ultimately decided to make it 100% public including the dev branch. 

## What does it do?
Solomon is primarily for DOM manipulation done quickly. However, as it evolves this may change. That said, the project
will always have a strong focus on the DOM.

## Contribution
All contributions should follow my [Simple contribution style guide](https://github.com/DavidMcKissick/Simple-commit-style-guide),
however due to this being a very small project, this is more a guideline than a law. If the project grows, more effort will
be spent on style requirements.
