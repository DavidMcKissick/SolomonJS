# SolomonJS
A generic javascript library for internal use currently focusing on dom manipulation.

## Who what and why?
Solomon is mostly made for personal projects, however as the project has grown, a few friends and colleagues have shown
interest. So I've ultimately decided to make it 100% public including the dev branch. 

## What does it do?
Solomon is primarily for DOM manipulation done quickly. However, as it evolves this may change. That said, the project
will always have a strong focus on the DOM.

## Contribution
All contributions should follow my [Simple contribution style guide](https://github.com/DavidMcKissick/Simple-commit-style-guide),
however due to this being a very small project, this is more a guideline than a law. If the project grows, more effort will
be spent on style requirements.
