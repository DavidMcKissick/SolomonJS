## Who what and why?
Solomon is mostly made for personal projects, however as the project has grown, a few friends and colleagues have shown
interest. So I've ultimately decided to make it 100% public including the dev branch. 

## What does it do?
SolomonJS began as a simple dom manipulation library but has grown to a simple, powerful dom-based ux system, allowing you to write your static web application in nearly pure javascript.

### Features
* Powerful DOM manipulation, simplified for faster development.
* Built-in (optional) router for single page web applications.
* Generics for use with custom code and other libraries.

## Contribution
All contributions should follow my [Simple contribution style guide](https://github.com/DavidMcKissick/Simple-commit-style-guide),
however due to this being a very small project, this is more a guideline than a law. If the project grows, more effort will
be spent on style requirements.

## NOTICE: Pre-minified SolomonJS releases will be discontinued until beta release
